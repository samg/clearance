Ok, enough fancy automatic stuff. Time for some old school monkey copy-pasting.

1. A a clearance.yml config file has been created in your config/ directory.

Use it to configure the host name and sender of clearance generated emails.
In production it must be the actual host your application is deployed to.
The config is used by mailers to generate URLs in emails.

It can look like this:

production:
  host: you_production_host.com
  do_not_reply: do_not_reply@you_production_host.com

2. Define root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb:

    map.root :controller => 'home'
